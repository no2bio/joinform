              This form offers a way to securely send us a message and/or initiate a secure chat with us.<br>
              <strong>Note:</strong> the only mandatory field is the captcha test :)<br>
              Recommended precautions:
              <ul>
                <li>Use a browser that doesn't save history (e.g. a
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-browse-web-without-saving-info">Firefox private window</a>
                    or a
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">Chrome incognito window</a>).</li>
                 <li>Although we don't log your IP number (neither here, nor at the <a target="_blank" href="http://etherpad.org">etherpad</a> chat server),
                     if anonymity is a concern for you, you should use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org">tor</a>
                     (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning">wisely</a>)
                     to avoid <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis">traffic analysis</a> by others.</li>

                <dt id="pad-id-help"><i class="icon-hand-right"></i> What is a pad-id?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>The chat will be conducted via an <a target="_blank" href="http://ethepad.org">etherpad</a> at
                  <strong>{{idprefix}}/<code>pad-id</code></strong><br>
                  where <code>pad-id</code> is a <strong>secret</strong>.<br>
                  <em>You don't need to enter a pad-id into the form</em>. If you leave it blank,
                  the system will choose an ugly random <code>pad-id</code> for you :).</p>
                  <p>In some cases it can be handy for you to choose something you can [hopefully] memorize
                  (you shouldn't save it as a bookmark or write it down anywhere).
                  This way, althogh we may not know <em>who</em> you are (i.e. there's no "account verification"),
                  at least we can assume you're <em>probably</em> the same person we've chatted with before (i.e. you have "accountability").</p>
                  <p>It's a bit like registering an account in social networks or other services, only instead of
                  the bothersome signing up process where you have to "verify who you are" by revealing information
                  about yourself, agree to some draconian "privacy policy" etc.
                  all you need to do is to invent and memorize a long password :).</p>
                  <p>Depending on the case, you may or may not wish to tell us more about yourself (and we may
                  or may not choose to believe what you say ;p ).
                  In some situations, you may even decide to meet us face to face so that you can "verify your account"
                  via the most popular and least documented protocol of all times &mdash; a physical handshake :).</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What if I forget the pad-id?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Not much.
                     You'll simply be considered a "new person" (and we won't have reason to believe you're "the same person").</p>
                </dd>

                <dd>
                  <p>The system checks that it's:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>At least {{idminchars}} characters long.</li>
                    <li>Only contains letters, numbers, "-", and "_" (e.g. <code>I-have-a-fAt-d0g-w1thout-a-nos3</code>).</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>It should also:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Not be something that can be found on the net (e.g. no song lyrics, and <em>certainly</em> not <code>I-have-a-fAt-d0g-w1thout-a-nos3</code> ;) ).</li>
                    <li>Be easy [for you] to remember, yet hard [for anyone else] to guess
                        (e.g. a variation on the punch-line of a joke your granny used to tell in a foreign language).</li>

                <dd>
                  <p>Although <em>communication</em> between you and the etherpad chat server is encrypted,
                     the pads (containing the conversation) are stored on the server's disk unencrypted, and that information might be compromised in
                     some scenarios (the pad-id leaks, someone gains control over the server or the client, etc.).<br>
                     It's true that <em>you can always delete the entire pad you're in</em>, but
                     how would that work in practice?
                     Suppose you want to say something sensitive, and delete the pad
                     as soon as your peer confirms
                     reading the information
                     (at the price of losing the pad's content and history).
                     What do you do if there's no one on the other side? Wait until someone is online?
                     What should your peer do with the message you're about to delete?
                     Copy/paste the information? Where?
                  </p>
                  <p>The <em>encrypted message</em> field lets you send your message as a
                     <a target="_blank" href="http://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> encrypted email. It is kept encrypted
                     on the personal inbox[es] of team member[s] and only gets decrypted temporarily "on a need to know basis"
                     by people who are [hopefully] security-minded, and [even more hopefully] would try their best
                     to refuse decrypting these messages if coerced to do so (disclaimer: this sentence isn't
                     legally binding. My client wasn't thinking).
                  </p>
                  <p>Bottom line: if it's <em>really</em> sensitive, don't mention it at the pad. Send an encrypted message instead.
