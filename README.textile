WhatMail by @TheRealDod

This is a simple cgi contact form that has recaptcha and can handle utf-8.

I always need one, and I always end up writing it again. Never again [I hope].

Uses Recaptcha "client library":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/recaptcha-client and Denevers "mysender":http://github.com/denever/mysender/ SMTP wrapper (both included).

There's no email address validation and no assumption that such an address is entered at all.
It's not added as a Reply-to header so that I won't reveal my email address by accident.
My friends can leave a name, strangers can leave a phone number, I'm easy :)

To install:

* Put all files (including .htaccess) in a web-accessible folder.

* Check your .htaccess settings by accessing testcgi.py from web: If you see
  python source, do *not* continue to the next step (creating whatconf.py). This file
  will contain passwords and keys, and you have to make sure it can't be accessible
  from web. If .htaccess doesn't do the trick, show it to your sysadmin and ask to config
  your folder at the apache according to what's written there.

* copy whatconf_example.py to whatconf.py and edit it. See comments inside the file.

* That's it. You can now access the folder via web (e.g. /whatmail/) and get a contact form.
  Send yourself a message to congratulate yourself.
