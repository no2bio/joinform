/**** Useful stuff for etherpad-lite configuration

Backend: redis rocks IMHO. http://blog.bigdinosaur.org/node-dot-js/

At the etherpad-lite folder, you need to "npm install" [at least] the following packages:
* ep_push2delete (lets people delete entire pad)
* ep_hide_referrer (hides the pad's url when user follows an external link)
* ep_remove_embed (If we want the url to stay confidential, an embed button sends a confusing message :) )

Here are some useful values for settings.json

  // Avoiding pad creation DoS:
  // Set PAD_API_KEY at tipwire's whatconf.py to the content of etherpad's APIKEY.txt
  // A successfull tipwire request would also create [if needed] the relevant pad via API
  // In that case, you can disable auto-creation of pads via web by adding this:
  "editOnly" : true,

  // example default text for a TipWire pad (assumes editOnly is true. See above)
  "defaultPadText" : "Welcome to TipWire. [Warning! Experimental!]\nThis page is called a pad ( http://etherpad.org ), and it enables a team to collaborate on text in real time.\nIt can be a real time chat, a place to leave each other offline messages, a joint statement, an article, a schedule, or all of the above.\n\n*You can start typing*\n\nA member of our team will join you here as soon as possible and chat with you.\nMeanwhile, you can start writing here whatever you think is relevant for the conversation\n(feel free to delete this introduction text once you finish reading it).\n\n*Don't leak this page's address*\n\nYou've probably arrived here via the secure form at https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire and have read the words of caution there.\nSince you understand that the addrress of this page should remain a secret, your browser is [hopefully] configrued not to save browsing history:\nEither you're using Firefox and hit Ctrl-Shift-P for a private window,\nyou use chrome and clicked Ctrl-Shift-N for an incognito window,\nor you're using a tor-browser https://www.torproject.org/ ( wisely: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning )\n\nIn case you forgot to do any of the above, best is to close this browser tab, clear your recent browsing history, and come back here \"properly\".\nIf you don't know how to clear history, you should delete this pad (see below) and request a chat again ( try not to do this often :) ).\n\n*The \"Delete\" button [No! don't touch it! :)]*\n\nEverything you type here (even if you erase it later on) is accessible (check out the clock icon).\nThis information may leak in various scenarions (the address of this page leaks, someone gains control of the server or your machine, etc.).\n\nThis is why for extra sensitive information, best is to use the \"encrypted message\" field at the TipWire form: https://swatwt.com/tipwire/#encrypted-help\n\nIn case you make a terrible mistake like leaking this page's address or writing something \"too sensitive\" here - there's a \"last resort\" measure:\nThe \"Delete\" button above will erase this pad along with its entire history.\n\nIf you reload the page, you'll see a \"You do not have permission to access this pad\" message.\nIn order to recreate this [or some other] pad, you'll need to request a chat again at https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire\nAs you can see, the \"Delete\" button is quite a harsh measure. Try to avoid needing it :)\n\n",
