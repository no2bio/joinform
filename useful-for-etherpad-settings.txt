/**** Useful stuff for etherpad-lite configuration

Backend: redis rocks IMHO. http://blog.bigdinosaur.org/node-dot-js/

At the etherpad-lite folder, you need to "npm install" [at least] the following packages:
* ep_push2delete (lets people delete entire pad)
* ep_hide_referrer (hides the pad's url when user follows an external link)
* ep_remove_embed (If we want the url to stay confidential, an embed button sends a confusing message :) )

Important!!! ep_hide_referrer doesn't hide referrer for links in the chat.
Until this problem is fixed, you need to manually patch src/static/js/chat.js as explained at
https://github.com/JohnMcLear/ep_hide_referrer/issues/2

Tip: always show chat (since chat is more suitable for beginners)
Add chat.stickToScreen(true); To the costumStart function at static/custom/pad.js

Here are some useful values for settings.json:

  // Avoiding pad creation DoS:
  // Set PAD_API_KEY at tipwire's whatconf.py to the content of etherpad's APIKEY.txt
  // A successfull tipwire request would also create [if needed] the relevant pad via API
  // In that case, you can disable auto-creation of pads via web by setting the editOnly flag:
  "editOnly" : true,

  // example default text for a TipWire pad (assumes editOnly is true. See above)
  "defaultPadText" : "Welcome to TipWire. [Warning! Experimental!]\nThis page is called a pad ( http://etherpad.org ), and it enables a team to collaborate on text in real time.\nIt can be a real time chat, a place to leave each other offline messages, a joint statement, an article, a schedule, or all of the above.\n\nA member of our team will join you here as soon as possible and chat with you, but since human beings are not always instantly available, please introduce yourself or what you want to talk about, or at least be polite enough to say \"hi\" :). It might take time, but you won't be ignored.\n\n***Chat or pad?\nFor real time discussion (where people often type at the same time) best is to use the chat line (bottom right) so that things don't get mangled, but if you have something long to say, best is to type it at here at the pad:\nThe text you're reading now is editable (feel free to erase it if you no longer need it).\nIf you see that no one else is online, best is to type what you want to say here, where it can be longer, you can edit it, etc.\nIf you're not sure, do whatever feels right for you :)\n\n***Don't leak this page's address\nYou've probably arrived here via the secure form at https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire and have read the words of caution there.\nSince you understand that the addrress of this page should remain a secret, your browser is [hopefully] configrued not to save browsing history:\nEither you're using Firefox and hit Ctrl-Shift-P for a private window,\nyou use chrome and clicked Ctrl-Shift-N for an incognito window,\nor you're using a tor-browser https://www.torproject.org/ ( wisely: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning )\n\nIn case you forgot to do any of the above, best is to close this browser tab, clear your recent browsing history, and come back here \"properly\".\nIf you don't know how to clear history, you should delete this pad (see below) and request a chat again ( try not to do this often :) ).\n\n***The \"Delete\" button [No! Don't touch it! :)]\nEverything you say in the chat or type into the pad (even if you erase it later on) is accessible (check out the clock icon).\nThis information may leak in various scenarions (the address of this page leaks, someone gains control of the server or your machine, etc.).\nThis is why for extra sensitive information, best is to use the \"encrypted message\" field at the TipWire form: https://swatwt.com/tipwire/#encrypted-help\n\nIn case you make a terrible mistake like leaking this page's address or writing something \"too sensitive\" here - there's a \"last resort\" measure:\nThe \"Delete\" button above will erase this pad along with its entire history.\n\nIf you reload the page after deleting the pad, you'll see a \"You do not have permission to access this pad\" message.\nIn order to recreate this [or some other] pad, you'll need to request a chat again at https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire\nAs you can see, the \"Delete\" button is quite a harsh measure. Try to avoid needing it :)\n\n",
