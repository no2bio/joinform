  //example default text for a TipWire pad
  "defaultPadText" : "Welcome to TipWire. [Warning! Experimental!]\nThis page is called a pad ( http://etherpad.org ), and it enables a team to collaborate on text in real time.\nIt can be a real time chat, a place to leave each other offline messages, a joint statement, an article, a schedule, or all of the above.\n\nA member of our team will join you here as soon as possible and chat with you.\nMeanwhile, you can start writing here whatever you think is relevant for the conversation\n(feel free to delete this introduction text once you finish reading it).\n\nAnd now - a few words of caution:\nNormally, people arrive here after selecting a secret pad id and submitting it to us via the secure form at https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire\nThis means that unless something bad happens, the address of this pad should only be known to you and our team.\nIt is advised to only visit this page with your browser configrued not to save browsing history\n(like firefox's private window https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-browse-web-without-saving-info or chrome's incognito window https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464 ).\nIn case you forgot to do that, please *close this page now* and clear your recent browsing history.\nWe don't log your IP number, but if it's important to hide the fact *that* you're using our systems, best is to use a tor-browser ( https://www.torproject.org/ ).\nAlso note that everything you type here (even if you erase it later on) is kept forever.\nIn case you write here something you don't wish documented later on - you can always use the *Delete* button above\nto erase this pad along with its entire history (reloading the page will create a fresh new pad).\nSince this is quite a harsh measure, try to avoid needing it :)\nFor extra-sensitive information, best is to use the encrypted message field at the TipWire form: https://dubiousdod.org/tipwire",
